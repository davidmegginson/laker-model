Blender model of the Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge
=============================================================

This is a Public Domain, medium-resolution model of a classic 3-hold Great Lakes freighter ("Laker"), with the wheelhouse forward and the crew quarters and stack at the back.  These boats (never "ships") are ubiquitous on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River for thousands of kilometers from Montreal QC to Duluth MN to Gary IN, built long and narrow to fit into the locks on the St. Lawrence Seaway.

This one is loosely modelled on the famous _Edmund Fitzgerald,_ but is not meant to be a precise replica.

This model is intended initially for use in the open-source FlightGear flight simulator, but is free for anyone to use.
