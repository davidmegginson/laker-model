Blender model of a Great Lakes freighter
========================================
This is a Public Domain, medium-resolution model of a classic 3-hold Great Lakes freighter ("Laker"), with the wheelhouse forward and the crew quarters and stack at the back.  These boats (never "ships") are ubiquitous on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River for thousands of kilometers from Montreal QC to Duluth MN to Gary IN, built long and narrow to fit into the locks on the St. Lawrence Seaway.

This one is loosely modelled on the famous _Edmund Fitzgerald,_ but is not meant to be a precise replica.

This model is intended initially for use in the open-source [FlightGear flight simulator](https://flightgear.org), but is free for anyone to use.


## Variants

In addition to the basic laker, there are three other variants:

- laker-bulk — a bulk load instead of hatches over the holds
- laker-crane — a self-unloading laker with a bulk load
- laker-csl — a laker with Canada Steamships Line livery on the stack


## Changes

### 2024-10-25

- added night lighting and reorganised directories

### 2024-08-31

- added basic textures to model (not super accurate, but sufficient)

### 2024-08-30

- added AC3D export for FlightGear
- added basic colouring
- mesh is complete (except for maybe a rudder); colours and textures still to come
